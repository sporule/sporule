#### Theme Configurations

These configuration will be used for that specific theme only, they are located under templates/_templateConfig.js. Look at the theme documentation to understand what is available. You will not be able to change the template configuration unless you fork the template repo. Please see change templates section for more details.

![TemplateConfig](https://i.imgur.com/mVoIG2w.png)

## Quick Start - Your Content

Put all your markdown files under the post folder, you will need to put the meta data in the front matter, see an example below.

![Example Markdown](https://i.imgur.com/Jqodi7S.png)

## Quick Start - Deployment Set up Option 1 - Github Page

### What is Github Page

This [link](https://pages.github.com/) gives you all you need to know about github page.

### Sign Up for GitHub Action

The link is: [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions)

![GitHub Action](https://i.imgur.com/KRIawwK.png)

### Enable Github Action in your Forked Repo

![GitHub Action](https://i.imgur.com/CO0ISQk.png)

Click Actions and look at the terms before click agreement.

### Set up the deployment key for GitHub Action

- Generate RSA public and private key pairs by using your usual software, otherwise you can generate it online. I randomly searched one in google, [click here](https://8gwifi.org/sshfunctions.jsp)
- It should be RSA key and the size is 2048.

![RSA Key Generator](https://i.imgur.com/EbjIUXZ.png)

- Go to your repo settings, add a new deploy key by coping the public key we generated.

![Deploy Key](https://i.imgur.com/gVKjFti.png)

- Go to secrets, add a new secret by coping the private key we generated. The name of the secret must be  **ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY** as this is what we have in our github action.

![Secret](https://i.imgur.com/KmxsoWD.png)

### Update the CNAME file if you are using custom domain in Github Pages

The CNAME file is under gh-pages/, add your custom domain to the CNAME file. Leave CNAME as empty if you are using the default github pages domain.

![Example CNAME](https://i.imgur.com/I6iJPst.png)

### End of Github Pages Deployment Set Up

You blog will get updated automatically everytime you make any changes in your git repo.

## Change Templates

Currently the Sporule system use Github submodule system for templates, which means you will not be able to edit template config if you don't fork the template repo yourself. There are two ways to change or update the template:

1. Turn the submodule into the actual files and commit into your repo.
2. Fork the template and commit any changes to your forked template(easier to upgrade if template upgrades in the future).

### Fork the Template Repo

You can find all templates under [https://github.com/sporule](https://github.com/sporule).

You will need to fork one of the template you want to use.

### Remove the current template

Credits to [this page](https://gist.github.com/myusuf3/7f645819ded92bda6677)

- Delete everything in the .gitmodules file
- Delete the template folder
- Delete the section of [submodule "template"] in .git/config file
- Run git rm --cached template
- Delete this folder .git\modules\template
- Commit the changes

### Add the template you want

Run git submodule add --force << Your Fork Repo >> template.

### Update template or template files

Please make sure you go into your template folder and then commit and push your changes back to your fork repo.
